  * Creating a PoC around local CI/CD with Podman + Jenkins.
  
### Tech Stack

To see the technologies I frequently use, you can check my [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/acikgozb/my-infrastructure-stack) page.
This is the place I try to keep as up-to-date as possible, by either adding new tools or reasons why I use them.
  
Since I primarily focus on DevOps, I did not add the primary languages and tools I used in Frontend & Backend.

  ## How Do I Use My Github?
  The main repositories for "showcasing" are the ones I pin on my main profile page. These repositories are the ones I pay attention the most, and update as regularly as possible.

  To see what I've been up on infrastructure related things, you can check those repositories.

  The rest is mostly POC type repositories, where I loosen up things a little bit and play around certain concepts.
